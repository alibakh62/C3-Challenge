# C3-Challenge

This repo contains my solution to the c3.ai COVID [Challenge](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-covid-19-grand-challenge/how-it-works/).

# Projects may address but are not limited to:

-   Applying machine learning/AI methods to mitigate the spread of COVID-19
-   Genome-specific COVID-19 medical protocols, including precision medicine of host responses​
-   Biomedical informatics methods for drug design and repurposing existing therapies​
-   Design and sharing of clinical trials for collecting and analyzing data on medications, therapies, and interventions​
-   Modeling, simulation, prediction of COVID-19 propagation and efficacy of interventions​
-   Logistics and optimization analysis for design of public health strategies and interventions​
-   Rigorous approaches to designing sampling and testing strategies​
-   Data analytics for COVID-19 research harnessing private and sensitive data, including the role of edge computing/IoT for gathering data​
-   Improving societal resilience in response to the spread of the pandemic​
-   Broader efforts in biomedicine, infectious disease modeling, response logistics and optimization, public health, tools, and methodologies around the  containment of infectious diseases, and response to pandemics so as to be better prepared for future infectious disease response.​

# Some thoughts & ideas:

- There are few critical areas for any viral disease:
  - Virus spreading and transmission
  - Asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding (the incubation period)
  - Diagnosis
  - Treatment
  - Vaccine development
  - Origin of virus
  - Viral pathogenesis
